As a user I can create a food item so I can resue it later.

As a user I can create a meal from food items with the correct weight for each food item, I can reuse this in the future.

As a user I can register a log that can either be a single food item or a meal. 

As a user I can retrieve logs from current or past days and be shown total macros for that day.

As a user I can only see my own data.
